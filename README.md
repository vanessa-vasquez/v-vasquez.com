# vanessa's portfolio - v1

This is the first iteration of my personal website built using React and Bootstrap. <br /> See it here: https://vanessa-vasquez.github.io/.

> A little fun fact about this project, this is my first ever React project and I built this as a way of learning the framework. <br /> Reach out to me if you have any recommendations/improvements to the code and/or design! 

## set-up

1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run a local development server: `npm start`
