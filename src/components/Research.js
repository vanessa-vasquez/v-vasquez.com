                    <p> Determined to provide librarians with a better system to communicate with students, 
                        we created a user environment design (UED) to help us get started on a concrete way 
                        to think about a librarianâ€™s user journey.

                    <p> Our UED condensed librarian work flow into six focus areas: a login page, a dashboard page, 
                        a consultation page, a calendar page, a library resources page, and a logout page. 
                        Its purpose was to streamline the communication between librarians and students as 
                        well as provide them with easy access to the library resources that they use in their 
                        day-to-day. <br />
                        From this UED, we were able to generate a low fidelity prototype that we used to test 
                        on our user group.
